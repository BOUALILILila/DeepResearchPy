Use the same language and tone as the user in your answer.

{% if knowledge_items %}
You have successfully gathered some knowledge which might be useful for answering the original question. Here is the knowledge you have gathered so far:
<knowledge>
{% for item in knowledge_items %}
{{ item }}
{% endfor %}
</knowledge>
{% endif %}

{% if action_history %}

<action-history>
{% for action in action_history %}
{{ action }}
{% endfor %}
</action-history>
{% endif %}

{% if bad_actions %}

- Reject Reason: {{ attempt.evaluation }}
- Actions Recap: {{ attempt.recap }}
- Actions Blame: {{ attempt.blame }}
</attempt-{{ loop.index }}>
{% endfor %}
</bad-attempts>

{% if bad_actions | selectattr("improvement") | list %}
Based on the failed attempts, you have learned the following strategy:
<learned-strategy>
{% for attempt in bad_actions %}
{{ attempt.improvement }}
{% endfor %}
</learned-strategy>
{% endif %}
{% endif %}

{% if enforce_answer %}
Based on the current context, you must absolutely produce a definitive answer, failure is not an option. 
Do not hesitate and give your final answer to the user.
{% else %}
Based on the current context, you must choose one of the following actions:
<actions>
{% for action in action_sections %}
